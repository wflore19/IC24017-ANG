**Organization:** Air National Guard

**Challenge:** Travel the World, Build Great Things!

## Abstract
The U.S. Air National Guard 786 Civil Engineering Squadron embarks on an important project at Ramstein Air Base, one of the military's most significant hubs, marking the upcoming fiscal year's most planning-intensive initiative (08/2024 - 09/2025). This endeavor aims to construct a warehouse for storing building maintenance materials and supplies, addressing the base's operational needs. With an estimated completion time of six months, the project demonstrates a strategic development phase in enhancing logistical efficiency at the base.

To help this undertaking, 40 units have applied to participate in the Deployment For Training (DFT) program for FY25, promising a workforce of 30-50 trained construction workers, including durational staff and project managers. These personnel will benefit from free or low-cost housing and meals, alongside secured transportation to Ramstein Air Base, ensuring a focused and well-supported workforce.

The project is uniquely structured, with each ANG unit worker completing 2-week rotations to maximize efficiency and minimize disruption. Ramstein Air Base commits to providing all necessary construction design, materials, tools, and equipment, ensuring a seamless execution phase during the favorable Spring and Summer months (04/2025 - 08/2025).

## Deliverables
Deliverables for this project include a comprehensive Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Communication Plan, and a detailed Project Schedule, visualized through a Gantt Chart. These documents will guide the project's strategic direction, stakeholder engagement, communication flow, and timeline, ensuring a well-organized and successful completion of the warehouse construction at Ramstein Air Base.
